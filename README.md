# MFPlatformer

**NB its My First Platformer, not just MoFoPlatformer lmao**

## What is this?
This is just a quick repo to track my progress making the platformer game from the Brackey's video on [Godot platformer tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0). I followed the tutorial through then decided to add in a few more features and try and experiment and make this somewhat complete in itself as a game. 

Controls are preset/baked into Godot settings - left/A, right/D, Space/W
Mario style stomp, all SFX and art are from the brackey's video (so far)

## Things I've tried out or *will
- Basic UI
- Killing enemies
- *Menus
- *Pause menu
- *Win level
- *Multiple Levels
- *Double Jump
- *Animating my own char

## What next?
I want to use this to get used to creating things in Godot before diving into making something goofy and messy in the Blackjacques repo. That one, as much as I love the idea in my head, I am writing off. Will use that as my first trial of something from scratch.
